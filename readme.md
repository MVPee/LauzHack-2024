# 💡 About the project
> UBS LauzHack Hackathon Challenge (24 hours)

This project, developed during a 24-hour UBS hackathon, addresses the challenge of identifying identical users within a massive set of banking transaction data. By leveraging advanced data processing and matching algorithms, our solution efficiently detects and connects user profiles across multiple transactions, ensuring accuracy and scalability.

# 📜 Features:

- High-performance data parsing and analysis for large-scale datasets.
- Intelligent matching algorithms to identify duplicate users based on transaction patterns, metadata, and identifiers.
- Scalable and adaptable for integration into banking systems.

# ⚙️ Performance Stats:

- Transactions Processed: 1,450,000
- Time Taken: 90 seconds
- Matching Accuracy: 66%
